While navigating a roundabout, his car was hit by a taxi. At the time of the accident, he did not feel any pain. However, two hours later, while picking up something at home, he began experiencing back pain. He then went to the hospital, where an X-ray was conducted. No fractures or serious injuries were found, but the hospital granted him 4 days of medical leave. The following day, he visited a private clinic for a checkup. The clinic granted him 28 days of medical leave. He now wishes to pursue compensation against the taxi driver. However, there are two points of concern: He did not seek medical attention immediately after the accident, waiting two hours before visiting the hospital. As a truck driver and mover, his work is highly physical, raising the possibility that the injury could be pre-existing or work-related. What are your thoughts?

While navigating a roundabout, his car was hit by a taxi. At the time of the accident, he did not feel any pain. However, two hours later, while picking up something at home, he began experiencing back pain. He then went to the hospital, where an X-ray was conducted. No fractures or serious injuries were found, but the hospital granted him 4 days of medical leave. The following day, he visited a private clinic for a checkup. The clinic granted him 28 days of medical leave. He now wishes to pursue compensation against the taxi driver. However, there are two points of concern: He did not seek medical attention immediately after the accident, waiting two hours before visiting the hospital. As a truck driver and mover, his work is highly physical, raising the possibility that the injury could be pre-existing or work-related. What are your thoughts? Can he successfully claim compensation?"

While navigating a roundabout, his car was hit by a taxi. At the time of the accident, he did not feel any pain. However, two hours later, while picking up something at home, he began experiencing back pain. He then went to the hospital, where an X-ray was conducted. No fractures or serious injuries were found, but the hospital granted him 4 days of medical leave. The following day, he visited a private clinic for a checkup.

2024-12-21T15:01:13.307Z,Adrien Kwong,adrien@stepone.agency,"My client is a truck driver. On a Saturday, his day off, he was driving his family to a mall. While navigating a roundabout, his car was hit by a taxi. At the time of the accident, he did not feel any pain. However, two hours later, while picking up something at home, he began experiencing back pain. He then went to the hospital, where an X-ray was conducted. No fractures or serious injuries were found, but the hospital granted him 4 days of medical leave. The following day, he visited a private clinic for a checkup. The clinic granted him 28 days of medical leave. He now wishes to pursue compensation against the taxi driver. However, there are two points of concern: He did not seek medical attention immediately after the accident, waiting two hours before visiting the hospital. As a truck driver and mover, his work is highly physical, raising the possibility that the injury could be pre-existing or work-related. What are your thoughts? Can he successfully claim compensation?"
